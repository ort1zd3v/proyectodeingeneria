RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATION
WITH PETROECUADOR
YPF Ecuador, Inc. (former Maxus Ecuador, Inc.) and YPF S.A.
(NYSE: YPF) from Argentina would like to communicate the
successful completion of the negotiations which culminated with
the signature on December 27, 1996 of the new Production Sharing
Contract in Block 16 with the Government of the Republic of
Ecuador through Petroecuador.
In August of 1996 the Ecuadorian Government expressed its
desire to renegotiate the existing Service Contract into a
Production Sharing Contract.
As a request from the Minister of Energy and Mining Mr.
Alfredo Ad&uacute;m, between August and December 1996 the parties
worked intensely to reach and agreement for a Production Sharing
Contract which fulfills the objectives of protecting the interest
of the Ecuadorian Government and its people as well as the
interest of the Parties of Block 16.
YPF Ecuador, Inc. and YPF S.A. celebrate the successful
achievement of the negotiations, and at the same time would like
to manifest their willingness to continue working and investing
in Ecuador within the established legal framework.
Buenos Aires, January 29th, 1997.
